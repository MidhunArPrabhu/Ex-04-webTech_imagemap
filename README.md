            Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a town in Chengalpattu district in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, best known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. It is one of the famous tourist sites in India. The ancient name of the place is Thirukadalmallai.

            Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group of royal monuments, many carved out of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), the giant open-air rock relief the Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva.The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.[4]

            MGM Resorts International is an American global hospitality and entertainment company operating destination resorts in Las Vegas, Massachusetts, Detroit, Mississippi, Maryland, and New Jersey, including Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, and Park MGM.

The company began operations in 1987 as MGM Grand, Inc. and became MGM Mirage in 2000, after acquiring Mirage Resorts. In the mid-2000s, growth of its non-gaming (lodging, food, retail) revenue began to outpace gaming receipts and demand for high-rise condominiums was surging, with median property prices in Las Vegas twice the national average. The company shifted its focus from owning and operating resorts and casinos to developing and building real estate in the leisure and gaming industryâ€”launching the massive CityCenter mixed-use project, which was at the time of its construction the world's largest construction site and ranks as one of the most expensive real estate projects in history.City Center's development coincided with the global financial crisis, causing more than $1 billion in writedowns in its valuation.

            Covelong Beach is actually Kovalam beach that is located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal near a village named Covelong, Chennai, India. The British, unable to pronounce the name "Kovalam", conveniently named it Covelong. This is a fishing village 40 km from Chennai. Kovalam Beach is on the way to Mahabalipuram near the East Coast Road (popularly ECR).

            Kovalam Beach is one of the finest and beautiful beaches by nature. As it is near Chennai and is located on the way to Mahabalipuram, it is visited by thousands of people each day. Mostly the local crowd is higher in the beach.
            
            Fishing is the main occupation of the people here. Though the beach is famous, it is littered by tourists and the local people alike.
            
            Along with the beach, the village of Covelong, famous for its fishing activities draws many tourists. It is India's first surfing village. There are surfing schools here.
